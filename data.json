    "content": "The 77th Primetime Emmy Awards took place on Sunday night, with shows like Adolescence, Severance, The Bear, The White Lotus, and The Penguin vying for the top prizes at Los Angeles’s Peacock Theater. The Creative Arts Emmys, held on September 6 and 7, had already handed out several exciting awards, including for Bryan Cranston’s guest turn on The Studio and Julianne Nicholson’s chaotic arc on Hacks. But the main ceremony promised thrilling head-to-heads between, to name just a few, Adam Brody and Jeremy Allen White; Pedro Pascal and Noah Wyle; Ayo Edebiri and Jean Smart; and Bella Ramsey and Britt Lower… Exciting stuff, to be sure."

    "content": "The thrill of summer comes in like a lion, and fizzles out softly like a lamb. The heat, and all the glorious activities that come with it, inspire us to dress in vivid sunset-adjacent colors, explore unique locations, and spend languid afternoons drenched in silk, cotton-poplin, and coastal prep garb. But, for the fashion set, there is always that itch we can’t wait to scratch. It comes in the form of fall/winter 2025’s biggest trends."
